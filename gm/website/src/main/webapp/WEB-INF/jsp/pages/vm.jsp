</h1>
                    <p>GeneMANIA helps you predict the function of your favourite genes and gene sets on your own machine.
</p>
                    <p>The interface is backed by powerful analysis software and a large data warehouse containing extensive amounts of existing functional genomics data. The GeneMANIA virtual machine provides a local copy of the GeneMANIA webserver. Everything is self contained, and no internet access is required to use it.

                    <h2>Using the Virtual Machine</h2>
                    <p>
                    While the GeneMANIA virtual machine is self contained and does not require internet access, the recommended way of using it is to run it on a dedicated machine on a local area network. This allows anyone to access the GeneMANIA virtual machine over the network using their preferred operating system and browser. 
                    </p>
