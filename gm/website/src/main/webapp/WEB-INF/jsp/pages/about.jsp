<h1>About</h1>
<p>GeneMANIA helps you predict the function of your favourite genes and gene sets.</p>
<p>GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. You can use GeneMANIA to find new members of a pathway or complex, find additional genes you may have missed in your screen or find new genes with a specific function, such as protein kinases. Your question is defined by the set of genes you input.</p>
<p>If members of your gene list make up a protein complex, GeneMANIA will return more potential members of the protein complex. If you enter a gene list, GeneMANIA will return connections between your genes, within the selected datasets. <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/page/help">Learn more...</a></p>
           
<p>GeneMANIA is also accessible via a <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/page/plugin">Cytoscape plugin</a>, designed for power users.</p>
<p>GeneMANIA is actively developed at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/" class="external_link" >University of Toronto</a>, 
in the <a href="http://www.thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/" class="external_link" >Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research</a>, 
in the labs of <a href="http://www.baderlab.org/" class="external_link" >Gary Bader</a>  and 
<a href="http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/" class="external_link" >Quaid Morris</a>, with input from an 
independent <a href="people.jsf#advisoryBoard">scientific advisory board</a>. 
GeneMANIA development is funded by <a href="http://www.genomecanada.ca/" class="external_link" >Genome Canada</a>, 
through the <a href="http://www.ontariogenomics.ca/" class="external_link" >Ontario Genomics Institute</a> (2007-OGI-TD-05).</p>
